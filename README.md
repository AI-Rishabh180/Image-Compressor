# 📌 Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## 📖 Project Description

This project demonstrates how **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**—a fundamental concept of **Linear Algebra**—can be applied to efficiently compress digital images while preserving essential visual information.

The application represents an image as a matrix and performs **rank-k approximation using SVD**, significantly reducing storage requirements with minimal loss in image quality. By retaining only the most important singular values, the project achieves effective compression while maintaining perceptual fidelity.

The project follows a **clean and modular architecture**, with a clear separation between:
- Frontend visualization  
- Backend image processing logic  
- Evaluation and comparison metrics  

This structure ensures **clarity, scalability, and ease of understanding**.

## 🎯 Learning Objective

This project is designed to help learners **bridge the gap between mathematical theory and real-world applications**. It provides practical insight into how linear algebra concepts are used in modern machine learning and AI systems.

Key concepts demonstrated include:
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Low-rank matrix approximation
- Dimensionality reduction
- Image compression techniques

These ideas form the foundation of advanced techniques such as:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Generative AI models**
- **Low-Rank Adaptation methods (LoRA / QLoRA)**

By working through this project, learners gain hands-on experience with techniques that are widely used in **computer vision, data compression, and modern AI architectures**.
